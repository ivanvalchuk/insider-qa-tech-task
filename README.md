### The test cases have been automated using Playwright and Pytest using the Page Object Model for better maintainability.
### Below are the instructions on how to install the required libraries and run the tests.

#### Installation instructions
1. Download the latest Python version from https://www.python.org/downloads and install it (if not installed).
2. Download the latest version of Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it (if not installed).
3. Install the Pytest plugin using pip install "pytest-playwright".
4. Install the Pytest browsers with "playwright install".

#### Repository setup
1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/ivanvalchuk/insider-qa-tech-task.git
2. "cd" to the folder "insider-qa-tech-task".
3. The tests are located as follows:
- "./tests/test_desktop.py" contains test cases for running on Desktop.
- "./tests/test_mobile.py" contains test cases for running on Mobile.
4. Page objects can be found in the "./application.py" folder.
5. Pytest fixtures can be checked in the "./conftest.py" file.

#### Running intstructions
- "pytest" - runs the tests on both Desktop browsers and mobile.
- "pytest -m desktop" - runs the tests on Desktop browsers (e.g. Chromium).
- "pytest -m mobile" - runs the tests on emualated mobile devices (e.g. iPhone 15).
- "pytest -m desktop --lf" / "pytest -m mobile --lf" - re-runs the previous failed tests for Desktop / Mobile.
By default, the tests are run in the 'headed' mode and on Chromium browser on Desktop and iPhone 15. In order to change to the 'headless'  mode, please change this in "./pytest.ini" by setting 'headless' to 'True'. Adding support for other browsers (Firefox, Webkit) can be done in the "./conftest.py" file by adding them to the params of the corresponding fixtures, e.g. params = ['firefox', 'webkit', 'Galaxy S9'], params = ['iPhone 14', 'Pixel 7'].
For convenience, the tests are run in the slow mode, which can also be adjusted in the "./conftest.py" file by removing / modifying the value for "slow_mo" under the "get_browser" fixture.

#### How to set up reporting
1. Install the plugin for Allure reporting using "pip install allure-pytest".
2. Install Allure via "brew install allure" for Mac or check https://allurereport.org/docs/install for other operating systems.
3. "cd" to the folder "insider-qa-tech-task".
4. Run the command for generating the report: "allure serve report" and the report will be opened in a separate tab of the browser.

5. A generated test report can also be found under the "Actions" tab at https://github.com/ivanvalchuk/ui-automation-task 
   Click on a corresponding workflow run to see the details.

##### ***Please note that html report can also be generated by running the "pytest --html=report.html" command.

#### CI
The tests are also run on each push and pull request to the respository in GitHub, which is configured in "playwright.yml" as part of the ".github/workflows" folder. The test report is also generated there.

##### The generated html report can also be viewed by opening the "./report.html" file:

##### The screenshots of the found issues recorded in Allure Report can be found in the "./test_results" folder for reference purposes.
